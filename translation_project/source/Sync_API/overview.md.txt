# Overview

This is the official documentation for Todoist Sync API. A reference to the functionality our public API provides with detailed description of each API endpoint, parameters, and examples.

## Summary of contents

In the Getting started section we will try to present to you the Todoist API, in the simplest possible way, by using real examples, based on common tasks that many users want to accomplish.

After reading this section you should continue with the Authorization, in order to learn all the details on the best way to authenticate to our server.

The most important section is the Sync section, and you should read it next, where the way that the API works is explained.

The other sections are the reference documentation of the different Todoist objects and endpoints, and you can continue reading them in the order you need them.

## Python library

We currently have an official Python library supported by Doist to make the developer life easier.

You can find the Python library source code at its repository at Github.

You can also read the Python library documentation online.

Finally, thereâ€™s also a PyPI package ready for you to install.
