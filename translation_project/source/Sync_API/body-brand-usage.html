<p>Thanks for using Todoist’s API to build an application!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you plan to utilize Todoist’s logo or branding in the visual design&#13;
of your application or website, please adhere to&#13;
<a href="https://doist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Todoist-logo.zip">Todoist’s brand guidelines</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In addition, please take note of the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>“Todoist” cannot be the first word in your application’s name. It&#13;
can be used in the name of your app, though. For instance “x for&#13;
Todoist” or “x with Todoist”, etc. This makes it clear that your&#13;
application is created by you and not by Doist.</li>&#13;
<li>You must clearly state that your application is "not created by,&#13;
affiliated with, or supported by Doist” in your application&#13;
description.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By using the Todoist marks you agree to properly follow the above&#13;
brand guidelines as well as&#13;
our <a href="https://en.todoist.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>. For further&#13;
information about the use of the Todoist brand, please contact&#13;
