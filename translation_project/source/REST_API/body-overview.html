<p>This is the official documentation for Todoist REST API. Our original API,
named <a href="https://developer.todoist.com/sync/">Sync API</a>, provides an easy way to deal with full and partial
syncs, but it’s not so simple for individual calls. REST API aims to provide API
developers a friendly way to deal with the most basic features of Todoist API.</p>

<h3 id="request-and-response-format">Request and response format</h3>

<p>API endpoints accept arguments either as url-encoded values for non-POST
requests or as json-encoded objects encoded in POST request body with
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Type: application/json</code> header.</p>

<p>Each modification request may provide additional <code class="prettyprint">X-Request-Id</code> HTTP header that
could be used as an unique string to ensure modifications are applied only once
— request having the same id as previously seen would be discarded.</p>

<p>It’s is not required but can be handy if you need to implement any request
re-trying logic. This header value should not exceed 36 bytes. We will be
generating them with <code class="prettyprint">uuidgen</code> for shell and <code class="prettyprint">uuid.uuid4</code> for Python in the code
examples.</p>

<p>This API relies on standard HTTP response codes to indicate operation
result. The table below is a simple reference about the most used status codes:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Status code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>The request was processed successfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>The request was processed successfully without any data to return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4xx</td>
<td>The request was processed with an error and should not be retried unmodified as they won’t be processed any different by an API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5xx</td>
<td>The request failed due to a server error, it’s safe to retry later.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>All <code class="prettyprint">200 OK</code> responses have the <code class="prettyprint">Content-type: application/json</code> and contain a
JSON-encoded representation of one or more objects.</p>

<p>Payload of POST requests has to be JSON-encoded and accompanied with
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Type: application/json</code> header.</p>
