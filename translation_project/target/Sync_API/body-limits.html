          <h1 id="limits">Limits</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There is currently a 1MiB http request body limit on POST requests. The
exception to this rule is any of the <em>upload</em> endpoints which have a limit of
100 MiB.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Upload endpoints are for POST requests pointed at paths such as <code class="prettyprint">/upload</code> and <code class="prettyprint">/uploads/add</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2 id="sync">Sync</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The maximum number of commands is 100 per request, and this is done to prevent
timeouts and other problems when dealing with big requests.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There’s also a maximum number of 50 sync requests per minute for each user, in
order to prevent clients from accidentally overloading our servers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3 id="processing-timeouts">Processing Timeouts</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are processing timeouts associated with each endpoint and these vary
depending on the type of action being performed.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>You can make a total of 50 requests per minute per user when using the Sync
API. This can be further increased when commands are batched where it’s
possible to use up to 100 batched commands can per request, giving us 5000
commands in this instance.</p>&#13;
