          <h1 id="webhooks">Webhooks</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Todoist Webhooks API allows applications to receive real-time notification
(in the form of HTTP POST payload) on the subscribed user events. Notice that
once you have a webhook setup, you will start receiving webhook events from
<strong>all your app users</strong> immediately.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3 id="important-considerations">Important Considerations</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Due to the nature of network requests, your application should assume webhook
requests could arrive out of order or could even fail to arrive; webhooks should
be used only as notifications and not as a primary Todoist data source (make
sure your application could still work when webhook is not available).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Before you can start receiving webhook event notifications, you must first have
your webhook configured at the App Management Console.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3 id="events">Events</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here is a list of events that you could subscribe to, and they are configured at
the <a href="../../appconsole.html">App Management Console</a>.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="event-json-object">Event JSON Object</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each webhook event notification request contains a JSON object. The event JSON
object follows this general structure:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><code class="prettyprint">{"event_name": "...", "user_id"=..., "event_data": {...}}</code></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The <code class="prettyprint">user_id</code> points to the destination of the event.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The structure of the <code class="prettyprint">event_data</code> object varies depending on the type of event
it is. For instance, if it is an “item:added” event notification, The
<code class="prettyprint">event_data</code> will represent the newly added item.</p>&#13;

<p>When an event notification failed to be delivered to your webhook callback URL
endpoint (i.e. due to server error, network failure, incorrect response, etc),
it would be re-delivered after 15 mins, and each notification would be
re-delivered for at most three times.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Your callback endpoint must respond with a HTTP 200 when receiving an event
notification request.</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A response other than HTTP 200 would be considered as failed delivery, and the
notification would be delivered again.</p>&#13;
