<p>In the <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a> section we will try to
present to you the Todoist API, in the simplest possible way, by using
real examples, based on common tasks that many users want to
accomplish.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After reading this section you should continue with
the <a href="#authorization">Authorization</a>, in order to learn all the details
on the best way to authenticate to our server.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The most important section is the <a href="#sync">Sync</a> section, and you
should read it next, where the way that the API works is explained.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The other sections are the reference documentation of the different
Todoist objects and endpoints, and you can continue reading them in
the order you need them.</p>&#13;
