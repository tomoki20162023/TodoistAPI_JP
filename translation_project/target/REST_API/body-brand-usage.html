<p>Thanks for using Todoist’s API to build an application!</p>

<p>If you plan to utilize Todoist’s logo or branding in the visual design
of your application or website, please adhere to
<a href="https://doist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Todoist-logo.zip">Todoist’s brand guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, please take note of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Todoist” cannot be the first word in your application’s name. It
can be used in the name of your app, though. For instance “x for
Todoist” or “x with Todoist”, etc. This makes it clear that your
application is created by you and not by Doist.</li>
<li>You must clearly state that your application is “not created by,
affiliated with, or supported by Doist” in your application
description.</li>
</ul>

<p>By using the Todoist marks you agree to properly follow the above
brand guidelines as well as
our <a href="https://en.todoist.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>. For further
information about the use of the Todoist brand, please contact
